# 📘 Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) practice repository!  
This repo contains a collection of problems I’ve solved while preparing for coding interviews and improving my problem-solving skills.

## ✨ About
This repository helps me:
- Track my DSA progress across various platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, Codeforces, etc.
- Organize solutions by topic and platform
- Share my approach and code with others
- Practice consistently and measure growth over time

## 📂 Structure
The repository is organized by topics such as:
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees & Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Sliding Window, Two Pointers, and more

Each folder contains:
- ✅ Problem statement (as a comment)
- ✅ Code solution (in Java, Python, or C++)
- ✅ (Optional) Approach and time/space complexity

## 💻 Platforms Covered
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
